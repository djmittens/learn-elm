# Learn Elm
So elm is a strongly typed functional programming language, loosely related to Haskell, it contains a MVC system thats message driven, and it seems like its a pretty pleasant experience for working in the browser.

## Installation
to install elm you just have to do this
```
npm install -g elm elm-test elm-format
```

VS code support for it seems to be pretty solid.
